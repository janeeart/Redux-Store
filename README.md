## Description
This web application was created by modifying starter code. I was provided with a fully functioning e-commerce platform that used React's Context API and I modified it to use Redux to manage global state.
  
## Usage
This app allows users to select items to add to their shopping cart and pay for the items with Stripe checkout.
  
## Installation
The user will run ```npm run seed``` and ```npm run develop``` in the terminal to run the project locally on their computer.
